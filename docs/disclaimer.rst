Disclaimer
==========
Large amounts of code and ideas have been... lent from other projects. Keeping
all copyright notices in the code would be unpractical, thus I have created
a directoy called "licenses". All copyright owners will get a place in this
folder, either by their own or their project's name. Also pygrafix's license can
be found there.
